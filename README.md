#### Chat mode

Chat with the AI assistant from your Vault to generate content for your notes.
From the chat, you can clic on any interaction to copy it directly to your clipboard.
You can also copy the whole conversation.
Chat mode now allows you to upload images to interact with GPT4-Vision or Claude models.

#### Prompt mode

Prompt mode allows you to use a selected piece of text from your note as input for the assistant.
From here you can ask the assistant to translate, summarize, generate code etc.

**Model Selection**: Choose different AI models for individual queries without changing your default settings. Select from OpenAI GPT-5 series, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Groq Cloud models, or the advanced GroqCloud Compound model per request.

**Critique Mode**: Enable a second AI model to analyze and provide feedback on the primary response. After receiving the initial response, wait 60 seconds for detailed critique with bullet-point feedback on accuracy, missing elements, clarity, and improvements.

**Built-in Prompts**: Eight specialized prompts are always available:
- **üìù Fix grammar and spelling (with highlights)** - Enhanced grammar correction with ==markdown highlighting== for all changes
- **üèóÔ∏è Suggest markdown structure improvements** - Document organization and readability suggestions

**Custom Prompts**: Define up to 3 frequently used prompts in the settings (e.g., "Translate to Spanish", "Summarize this text"). These will appear as quick-select options in the prompt modal, saving you time on common tasks.

**Response Length Selector**: Control the length of AI responses with three options:
- **Short** (~500 tokens) - Concise answers for quick information
- **Normal** (~3000 tokens) - Balanced responses for most use cases
- **Long** (~5000 tokens) - Detailed, comprehensive answers for complex topics
